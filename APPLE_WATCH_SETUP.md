# ⌚ Apple Watch Support - Setup Guide

## Current Status:
- ✅ iPhone/iPad app ready
- ❌ No Watch app yet (requires separate watchOS target)

## What You Can Do NOW:

**With just the iPhone app:**
- ✅ Install on iPhone (free testing)
- ✅ Voice recording works
- ✅ Notifications appear on Watch (if paired)
- ❌ No standalone Watch app

**Apple Watch can:**
- ✅ Show notifications from iPhone app (automatic!)
- ✅ Receive reminder notifications
- ❌ Cannot run the full web app (screen too small)

## To Add Watch App (Future Enhancement):

### Option 1: Simple Watch Companion (Recommended)

**What it would do:**
- Quick "Start Journal" button on Watch
- Opens iPhone app via deep link
- Shows reminder notifications (already works!)

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours of development)

### Option 2: Full Watch App

**What it would do:**
- Complete journal interface on Watch
- Voice recording on Watch
- View recent entries
- Standalone functionality

**Effort:** High (significant native watchOS development)

## Recommendation:

**For now:**
1. **Test on iPhone** (free, works great!)
2. **Notifications will show on Watch automatically** (when iPhone app sends them)
3. **Use iPhone for full journaling**

**Later (if needed):**
- Add simple Watch companion app
- Quick-start button on Watch
- Deep link to iPhone app

## Quick Test:

**Even without a Watch app:**
1. Install Voice Journal on iPhone
2. Set up daily reminders
3. **Notifications will appear on your Watch automatically!**
4. Tap notification → Opens iPhone app

**This works RIGHT NOW - no Watch app needed for notifications!**

**Focus on iPhone testing first, then we can add Watch support later if you want! 📱→⌚**
