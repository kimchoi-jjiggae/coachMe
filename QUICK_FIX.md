# 🚀 Quick Fix for Signing Errors

## Your Current Status:
- ✅ Team: "Michelle Choi (Personal Team)" (Free account)
- ❌ No device registered
- ❌ Cannot deploy to TestFlight (needs paid account)

## Option 1: Fix Signing for Device Testing (FREE - Do This First)

**In Xcode:**

1. **Connect your iPhone** via USB cable
2. **Unlock iPhone** and tap "Trust This Computer" if prompted
3. **In Xcode device dropdown** (top toolbar), select your iPhone
4. **Back in Signing & Capabilities tab:**
   - Click **"Try Again"** button (next to the error)
   - Wait for Xcode to register device and create profile

**If this works:**
- ✅ You can build and test on your iPhone (free!)
- ✅ App will work with notifications
- ❌ Still can't deploy to TestFlight (needs paid account)

## Option 2: Deploy to TestFlight (Requires $99/year)

**To use TestFlight, you need:**

1. **Sign up for Apple Developer Program:**
   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/programs/
   - Click "Enroll" → $99/year
   - Takes 24-48 hours for approval

2. **After approval:**
   - In Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
   - Sign out and sign back in
   - Select your PAID team (not "Personal Team")
   - Follow TestFlight deployment steps

## What to Do Right Now:

**Try Option 1 first** (connect iPhone):
- This will at least let you test the app on your device
- It's free and works immediately
- You can use this while deciding about TestFlight

**Then decide:**
- If you want TestFlight → Sign up for Developer Program ($99/year)
- If device testing is enough → You're done! (for now)

**Connect your iPhone and click "Try Again" in Xcode, then tell me what happens!**
